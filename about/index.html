                    <p>Sarah Newport is a 27 year old transplant to the Washington DC Metro Area, originally from Tampa, FL. Since her teenage years, she has had a deep curiosity about computer hardware and software. She graduated in May 2012 with a degree in International studies from the University of South Florida, which she pursued due to her love of being knowledgeable about different cultures around the world. Sadly, this degree did not lead to a fulfilling job that struck her with the same interest and passion she had about computers. She decided to apply to the post baccalaureate Computer Science program at Oregon State University and was accepted in the Fall of 2014. The experience at OSU has been life changing to say the least and she finally feels she is on the right path to a satisfying and challenging career.</p></div>
