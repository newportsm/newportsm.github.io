                <h3>How it all came to be...</h3>
                
                <p>Sarah Newport is a 27 year old transplant to the Washington DC Metro Area. Since her teenage years, she has had a deep curiousity about computer hardware and software. She graduated in May 2012 with a degree in International studies from the University of South Florida, which she persued due to her love of being knowledgable about different cultures around the world. Sadly, this degree did not lead to a fulfilling job that struck her with the same interest she had in computers. She decided to apply to the post-baccelarute Computer Science program at Oregon State University and was accepted in the Fall of 2014. The experience at OSU has been life changing to say the least and she finally feels she is on the right path to a statisfying and challenging career.</p>
